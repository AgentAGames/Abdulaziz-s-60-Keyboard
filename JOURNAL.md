## 10/25/2025 - Made The Idea | Positioned Schematic As Well  

After making a custom macropad following the guide given by hackclub and different discord servers. However, I felt that I needed to make something bigger and better. Thats when I came up of the idea of making a 60% keyboard that has RGB, bluetooth and a volume knob(rotary encoder). I began brainstorming and positioning the parts in KiCad schematic editor such as the switches, rgb, MCU, etc. I do remember that I spent a lot of time experimenting with different MCU's because of the pins that I had. In the end, I chose to go with these parts:

- x60 Morandi Switches
- x60 Hot swap sockets
- x1 Rotary Encoder EC11
- x2 Tactile Switches TL1105AF160Q
- x1 MINI-SPDT-SWITCH
- x1 Nice!Nano v2
- x1 Level Shifter 74LVCHZT45DC
- x1 Shift Register 74HC595
- JST 2 pin connector

After finding and placing the parts in the schematic, I wired the components together. However, I was confused on some logics such as the volts, GND. Thankfully, some forums and the "Keyboard Atelier" discord helped me fix some issues.

Note: I didn't do this in one day, the hour I spent is just an estimate of the total I spent.
