## 10/8/2025 - Getting Back To Work! Positioned components in PCB Editor

The next steps are to place the diodes and LED, and to determine which battery I will be using along with its size and specs."![Screenshot 2025-10-07 at 22.00.47.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAwMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4f6deaf4df42a9df7cfb22a16c7acdd6b44f16f7/Screenshot%202025-10-07%20at%2022.00.47.png)
